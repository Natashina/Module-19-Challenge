# Module-19-Challenge

## The purpose of this Challenge is to build your own machine learning model that will be able to predict the success of a venture paid by Alphabet soup and use different strategies on improving a model's performance.

1. Exploring the data types in our dataframe by org_df.dtypes, we find out that most of the columns are with categorical values and four columns with numerical values - EIN, STATUS, ASK_AMT, IS_SUCCESSFUL. Therefore we had to convert data with object data type to numeric. 

2. Looking at the unique value counts, there are variables that appear frequently in the dataset, however, many of them appear semi-frequently and even rarely appear in the dataset. According to the nunique method, some of the categorical variables have more than 10 unique values, such as APPLICATION_TYPE, CLASSIFICATION, etc.
The OneHotEncoder has been used to produce encoded DataFrames for APPLICATION_TYPE, CLASSIFICATION, AFFILIATION, etc. With Pandasâ€™ merge and drop methods
the original columns were replaced with encoded features.

3. ASK_AMT column contains 8747 different amounts. To group them there were eight bins created as following:  ['<10K', '10K-24.9K', '25K-99.9K', '100K-999.9K', '1M-4.9M', '5M-9.9M', '10M-49.9M', '50M+']. A new column ASK_AMT_Ranges has been created and then encoded. Columns with Status, ASK_AMT, NAME, EIN were dropped.

4. Deep learning model structure:  two hidden layers with 200 and 96 neurons in first and second layer respectively. All of our hidden layers use the relu activation function to identify nonlinear characteristics from the input values.
The results of training epochs are shown below.

5. In order to improve the perforemance we are going to use Random Forest Classifier to rank the importance of input variables.
The most important features are 'AFFIL_2','AFFIL_1', 'ORG_Association' and the least important are 'SPEC_CONS_N', 'SPEC_CONS_Y', 'USE_Other'.
